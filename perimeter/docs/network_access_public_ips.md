## Public IPs

This benchmark checks for Azure public IP addresses that may not be properly managed, including:

- Public IP addresses not properly tagged for inventory and governance
- Public IP addresses not associated with resources or security rules
- Orphaned public IP addresses that are not being used

Properly monitoring and managing public IP addresses is essential for maintaining a secure perimeter.
