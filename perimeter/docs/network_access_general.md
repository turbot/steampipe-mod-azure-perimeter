This benchmark answers the following questions:

- Are App Service and Function App VNet Integration enabled?
- Is Application Gateway WAF enabled?
- Is Network Watcher enabled?
- Do SQL Server and Storage account firewall rules prohibit public access?

Properly configuring these network security controls is essential for maintaining a secure perimeter. The App Service and Function App VNet Integration ensure that these services can securely communicate with resources in a virtual network. The Application Gateway WAF provides an additional layer of security against web application attacks. Network Watcher enables monitoring and diagnostics of network traffic, while SQL Server and Storage account firewall rules help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
