## Network General Access

This benchmark checks for Azure network general security controls, specifically:

- App Service VNet Integration enabled
- Application Gateway WAF enabled
- Function App VNet Integration enabled
- Network Watcher enabled
- SQL Server firewall rule prohibit public access
- Storage account network rules prohibit public access

Properly configuring these network security controls is essential for maintaining a secure perimeter. The App Service and Function App VNet Integration ensure that these services can securely communicate with resources in a virtual network. The Application Gateway WAF provides an additional layer of security against web application attacks. Network Watcher enables monitoring and diagnostics of network traffic, while SQL Server and Storage account firewall rules help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
