# Resource Policy Public Access

This benchmark answers the following questions:

- What Azure resources have configuration flags, settings, or properties that allow public access?
- Are there Cosmos DB accounts with CORS policies that allow public access?

Properly managing public access settings is essential for maintaining a secure perimeter. Public access settings should be carefully managed to ensure that only authorized principals have access to resources.
