## RBAC Shared Access

Azure RBAC controls who can access resources and what actions they can perform. Overly broad or misconfigured assignments can expose resources to risk.

This benchmark answers the following questions:

- Are there role assignments to untrusted users or groups or service principals?

Properly managing RBAC is essential for maintaining a secure perimeter. RBAC should be carefully managed to ensure that only authorized principals have access to resources.
