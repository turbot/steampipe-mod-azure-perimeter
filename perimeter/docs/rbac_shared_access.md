## RBAC Shared Access

Azure RBAC controls who can access resources and what actions they can perform. Overly broad or misconfigured assignments can expose resources to risk.

This benchmark checks for:
- Role assignments to untrusted or external principals
- Overly broad or cross-subscription assignments

Properly managing RBAC is essential for maintaining a secure perimeter. RBAC should be carefully managed to ensure that only authorized principals have access to resources.
