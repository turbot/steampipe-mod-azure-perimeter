# Public Access

Resources should not be publicly accessible as they could expose sensitive data to bad actors.

This benchmark evaluates Azure resources that could be made publicly accessible through various mechanisms such as configuration settings, resource policies, or network configurations. Public access can expose sensitive data, create security vulnerabilities, and increase the attack surface of your Azure infrastructure.
