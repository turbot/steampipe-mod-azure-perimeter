## Network Public Access

This benchmark checks for Azure networking resources that may have public access enabled, including:

- Public IP addresses not properly secured or monitored
- Load balancers with overly permissive public access rules
- Network interfaces with direct internet connectivity

Network resources with public access require proper security controls to minimize exposure to potential attacks.
