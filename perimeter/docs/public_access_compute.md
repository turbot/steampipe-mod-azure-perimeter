## Compute Public Access

This benchmark checks for Azure compute resources that may have public access enabled, including:

- Virtual machines with public IP addresses directly attached
- App Services with public network access enabled instead of using private endpoints
- Function Apps configured for public access

Publicly accessible compute resources can become targets for various attacks and should be properly protected.
