## Privileged Role Assignments

Privileged roles in Azure grant broad or sensitive permissions to resources. Mismanagement can lead to unauthorized access or data loss.

This benchmark answers the following questions:

- What privileged roles (Owner, Contributor, User Access Administrator, etc.) are assigned?
- Are privileged roles assigned only to trusted principals and at the minimum scope necessary?

Properly managing privileged role assignments is essential for maintaining a secure perimeter. Privileged roles should be assigned only to trusted principals and at the minimum scope necessary to perform their duties. Regular reviews of privileged role assignments can help identify and remediate potential security risks.
