# Shared Access

Shared access in Azure occurs primarily through Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), which provides fine-grained access management for Azure resources. Unlike public access, shared access involves deliberately granting permissions to specific principals (users, groups, or service principals) to access resources.

Shared access is a critical security control that should be carefully managed to ensure that only authorized principals have access to resources.
