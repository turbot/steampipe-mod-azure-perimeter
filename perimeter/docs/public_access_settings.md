# Public Access Settings

Resources should not be publicly accessible or exposed to the internet through configurations and settings.

This benchmark answers the following questions:

- What Azure resources are publicly accessible through configuration settings?
- Are storage account blob public access settings enabled?
- Are storage container blob public access settings enabled?
- Are Kubernetes clusters configured for public access?

Properly managing public access settings is essential for maintaining a secure perimeter. Public access settings should be carefully managed to ensure that only authorized principals have access to resources.
