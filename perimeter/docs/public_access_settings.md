# Public Access Settings

Resources should not be publicly accessible or exposed to the internet through configurations and settings.

This benchmark checks for:
- Storage account blob public access settings
- Storage container blob public access settings
- Kubernetes cluster public access settings

Properly managing public access settings is essential for maintaining a secure perimeter. Public access settings should be carefully managed to ensure that only authorized principals have access to resources.
