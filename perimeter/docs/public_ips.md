This benchmark answers the following questions:

- What compute VMs do not have public IPs?
- What network interfaces are not attached to public IPs?

Properly managing public IP addresses is essential for maintaining a secure perimeter. Public IP addresses should be limited to only those resources that truly require internet connectivity, and they should use static allocation to ensure consistent security configurations.
